Welcome to my website! I am a current PhD student in the Department of Agricultural Economics at the [University of Connecticut](https://are.uconn.edu). 

My research sits at the intersection of labor economics and empirical industrial organization, drawing on tools from environmental economics. I study how individuals and firms in both developed and developing economies respond to diverse economic shocks.

My current work examines the effects of ecological, technological, and climate shocks on productivity, labor demand, labor reallocation, and overall welfare. I am also interested in understanding price transmission mechanisms and gendered impacts, with a broader goal of understanding how shocks propagate through markets and households.

Methodologically, I combine structural empirical models with causal inference, spatial econometrics, and machine learning techniques. My research draws on administrative, survey, and high-resolution geospatial data to address policy-relevant questions.

Outside of research, I enjoy running, watching documentaries, and reading crime fiction.
