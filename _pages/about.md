Welcome to my website! I am a current PhD student in the Department of Agricultural Economics at the [University of Connecticut](https://are.uconn.edu). 

My research sits at the intersection of labor economics and empirical industrial organization, drawing on tools from environmental economics. I study how individuals and firms in developed and developing economies respond to ecological, technological, and climate shocks.

My current work examines the effects of these shocks on productivity, labor demand, labor reallocation, price transmission, and welfare. I am particularly interested in how shocks propagate through markets and households.

Methodologically, I combine structural empirical models with causal inference, spatial econometrics, and machine learning, drawing on administrative, survey, and high-resolution geospatial data.

Outside of research, I enjoy running, watching documentaries, and reading crime fiction.
